# mancala_project

Project Introduction:

Class project where I implemented a modified game of mancala and each player can either be set to play random moves, moves determined by an adjusted implementation of the aima python min-max algorithm or an adjusted implementation of the aima python alpha beta pruning algorithm. The maximum depth to which the min max tree searches can also be adjusted.
